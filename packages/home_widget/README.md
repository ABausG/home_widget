HomeWidget is a plugin to make it easier to create HomeScreen Widgets on Android and iOS.
HomeWidget does **not** allow writing Widgets with Flutter itself. It still requires writing the Widgets with native code. However, it provides a unified interface for sending data, retrieving data, and updating the Widgets.

To save data, call:
```dart
HomeWidget.saveWidgetData<String>('id', data);
```

To initiate a reload of the Home Screen Widget, you need to call:

);
```
