HomeWidget is a Plugin to make it easier to create HomeScreen Widgets on Android and iOS.
HomeWidget does **not** allow writing Widgets with Flutter itself. It still requires writing the Widgets with native code. However, it provides a unified Interface for sending data, retrieving data and updating the Widgets

| iOS                                                                                                            | Â Android                                                                                                           |
