# Background Update
As the methods of HomeWidget are static it is possible to use HomeWidget in the background to update the Widget even when the App is in the background.

The example App is using the [flutter_workmanager](https://pub.dev/packages/workmanager) plugin to achieve this.
Please follow the Setup Instructions for flutter_workmanager (or your preferred background code execution plugin). Most notably make sure that Plugins get registered in iOS in order to be able to communicate with the HomeWidget Plugin.
In case of flutter_workmanager this achieved by adding:
```swift
WorkmanagerPlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback { registry in
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: registry)
}
```
to [AppDelegate.swift](example/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift)
