# Analytics

Sometimes it can be useful to know which Widgets your Users have currently installed.

Using home_widget you can check which Widgets a User currently has added to their HomeScreen

```dart
final List<HomeWidgetInfo> info = await HomeWidget.getInstalledWidgets();
```

This will give you respective Information about the Widgets a User has currently installed with respective platform specific Widget Information filled.

<Info>Note that each combination of `iOSFamily`(Size) and `iOSKind`(Widget Type) will only appear once in the list due to limitations of iOS.</Info>
