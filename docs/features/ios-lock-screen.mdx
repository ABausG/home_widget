# iOS Lock Screen Widgets

On iOS, Lock Screen Widgets are a great way to show information to your users without them having to unlock their device.

## Supported Families
Technically, this works by adding another `family` to your widget's configuration.

```swift
var body: some WidgetConfiguration {
  ...
  .description("Lock Screen Widgets")
  .supportedFamilies([
      .systemSmall,
      .systemMedium,
      // Accessory Widgets are available on the Lock Screen only
      .accessoryCircular
  ])
```

## Adjust Layout

To adjust the layout of the widget, you can check which family/size is currently requested in the widget's layout code.

```swift
struct LockScreenWidgetView: View {
  var entry: Provider.Entry

  // Detect the current Family
  @Environment(\.widgetFamily) var family

  var body: some View {
    if family == .accessoryCircular {
      // Return Widget for Circular Lock Screen Widget
    } else {
     // Build Widget for other families
    }
  }
}
```
