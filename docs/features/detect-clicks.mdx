# Detect Clicks

home_widget offers functionality to check if your App was launched by clicking on an element in the HomeScreen Widget.

<Info>
Note that this is not for Interactive Widgets. For this please check the relevant documentation [here](/features/interactive-widgets).
</Info>

To detect this in your App there are two methods:

For when your App is started from the very backgound check:
```dart
HomeWidget.initiallyLaunchedFromHomeWidget();
```
this will return a `Future<Uri?>` with the Uri that was used to start the App.

When your App is already running all Widget clicks are broadcast to a Stream provided via:

```dart
HomeWidget.widgetClicked;
````
which is a `Stream<Uri?>` that you can listen to to detect App Launches from the Widget.title


## Platform Setup

In the following section you can learn how to add the necessary configurations to your native Widgets in order for clicks to bet detectable by home_widget.title

### iOS

Add `.widgetUrl` to your WidgetComponent
```swift
Text(entry.message)
    .font(.body)
    .widgetURL(URL(string: "homeWidgetExample://message?message=\(entry.message)&homeWidget"))
```
In order to only detect Widget Links you need to add the queryParameter`homeWidget` to the URL

### Android


Add an `IntentFilter` to the `Activity` Section in your `AndroidManifest`
```
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="es.antonborri.home_widget.action.LAUNCH" />
</intent-filter>
```

Add the following modifier to your Widget (import from HomeWidget)
```kotlin
Text(
   message,
   style = TextStyle(fontSize = 18.sp),
   modifier = GlanceModifier.clickable(
     onClick = actionStartActivity<MainActivity>(
       context,
       Uri.parse("homeWidgetExample://message?message=$message")
     )
   )
)
```
