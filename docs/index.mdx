# home_widget

HomeWidget is a Plugin to make it easier to create HomeScreen Widgets on Android and iOS.
HomeWidget does **not** allow writing Widgets with Flutter itself. It still requires writing the Widgets with native code. However, it provides a unified Interface for sending data, retrieving data and updating the Widgets
