# Update Widget

In order to initiate a reload of the HomeScreenWidget you need to call
```dart
HomeWidget.updateWidget(
    name: 'HomeWidgetExampleProvider',
    androidName: 'HomeWidgetExampleProvider',
    iOSName: 'HomeWidgetExample',
    qualifiedAndroidName: 'com.example.app.HomeWidgetExampleProvider',
);
```

<Info>
<b>Not</b> all the arguments are required. Depending on your setup you might need to call different arguments of the function.
For iOS either `name` or `iOSName` must match the `kind` that is defined for the Widget
For Android either `name` or `androidName` must the class Name of your Widget <b>Receiver</b>. Alternatively you can point to the receivers full class using `qualifiedAndroidName`
