# Read and Write Data

By default home_widget uses UserDefaults on iOS and SharedPreferences on Android to store data.
In this section it is explained how to save and read data from the Flutter App as well as how to access data from your HomeScreen Widgets

## Save Data

In order to save Data call
```dart
HomeWidget.saveWidgetData<String>('id', data);
```

## Read Data

To retrieve the current Data saved in the Widget call
```dart
HomeWidget.getWidgetData<String>('id', defaultValue: data);
```

Check out the platform documentation of
[iOS](/setup/ios#timelineentry--timelineprovider) and [Android](/setup/android#appwidget) <!-- cspell: disable-line -->
to see how to access this data in your widget.


## Background Update
As the methods of HomeWidget are static it is possible to use HomeWidget in the background to update the Widget even when the App is in the background.

The example App is using the [flutter_workmanager](https://pub.dev/packages/workmanager) plugin to achieve this.
Please follow the Setup Instructions for flutter_workmanager (or your preferred background code execution plugin). Most notably make sure that Plugins get registered in iOS in order to be able to communicate with the HomeWidget Plugin.
In case of flutter_workmanager this achieved by adding:
```swift
WorkmanagerPlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback { registry in
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: registry)
}
```
to [AppDelegate.swift](example/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift)
